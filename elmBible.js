//
// Effects must be queued!
//
// Say your init contains a synchronous command, like Time.now or Time.here
//
//   - This will produce a batch of effects (FX_1)
//   - The synchronous task triggers the subsequent `update` call
//   - This will produce a batch of effects (FX_2)
//
// If we just start dispatching FX_2, subscriptions from FX_2 can be processed
// before subscriptions from FX_1. No good! Earlier versions of this code had
// this problem, leading to these reports:
//
//   https://github.com/elm/core/issues/980
//   https://github.com/elm/core/pull/981
//   https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1776
//
// The queue is necessary to avoid ordering issues for synchronous commands.


// Why use true/false here? Why not just check the length of the queue?
// The goal is to detect "are we currently dispatching effects?" If we
// are, we need to bail and let the ongoing while loop handle things.
//
// Now say the queue has 1 element. When we dequeue the final element,
// the queue will be empty, but we are still actively dispatching effects.
// So you could get queue jumping in a really tricky category of cases.
